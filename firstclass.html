   <h2>1.INTRODUCTION </h2>
Initial Public offer (IPO) is a process through which an unlisted 
company can be listed to a Stock exchange by offering its securities 
to the public. The objective of an IPO may differ from company to company. 
It may be for expansion of existing activities of the company or setting up 
of new projects or just to get its existing equity shares listed by diluting the 
stake of existing equity shareholders through offer for sale or any other object 
as may be specified by the Company in its offer document. In an initial public offering 
(IPO), a private company becomes a public concern by issuing equity shares to the outside 
investors for the first time. IPO is a process through which Companies access the capital from market by selling a 
variety of securities, such as common stock, bonds and preferred stock. Certainly, companies have other ways of 
getting finance, such as retention of earnings; bank loan, overdraft etc., but the equity shares are the major source 
of funding. IPOs often come from smaller, younger companies seeking capital to expand their business. IPOs are quite 
risky to invest in. SEBI the Capital Market regulator, which was established with the objective of investor protection 
and regulation of capital markets, has issued many guidelines and introduced structural reforms to bring efficiency in 
the market and it, has brought out various norms the companies have to adhere to before approaching the primary capital market.
